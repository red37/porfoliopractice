  <h4> Some of Oliver's quotes (and analogies)are as follows:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Essentially, student debt is like HPV. If you go to college, you're almost certainly going to get it. And if you do, it will follow you for the rest of your life.</li>
  <li>We tolerate pumpkin spice because we like the fall. It's the best season because you get to stop thinking about how weird your legs look in shorts.</li>
  
  <li>Prison sentences are a lot like penises — if they're used correctly, even a short one can do the trick... is a rumor I have heard.</li>
  
  <li>When David Beckham got a tattoo of Jesus, the response from most soccer fans was, "That's huge for Jesus. That's a big deal for him."</li>
  
  <li>The Internet is supposed to be free, like parking on Sundays, or drinks at a a wedding thrown by non-assholdes</li>
  
  <li>Payday loans are like the Lay's Potato Chips of finance. You can't have just one and they're TERRIBLE for you.</li>
 
  <li>The death penalty is like the McRib. When you can't have it, it seems so tantalizing. But when they bring it back, you think, 'Wow, this is ethically wrong'</li>
  
  <li>At this point, we aren't just flirting with disaster; we're rounding third base and asking if disaster has any condoms.</li>
  
  <li>Because sex is like boxing, if one of the parties didn’t agree to participate, the other one is committing a crime.</li>
  
  <li>Drug companies are a bit like high school boyfriends. They're much more concerned with getting inside you than being effective once they're in there.</li>
  
</ol>
