<h1> Hello Bruce!</h1> 
<h2> A few facts about Batman</h2>
<img src ="http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/143/590x/batman-634742.jpg" />

<p><strong>Batman</strong> is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Originally named "the Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the "Caped Crusader", the "Dark Knight", and the "World's Greatest Detective".<br /></p>
<p>Batman's secret identity is <strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>, an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional <em>Gotham City</em>, with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his <strike>genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology,</strike> vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the<em><strong> <u>Joker</u></strong></em>.</p>

<h3> Somethings that you might not know about Batman</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bruce Wayne is named after Scottish hero Robert the Bruce and American Revolutionary hero Mad Anthony Wayne (who turns out to be an ancestor of Batman's, according to the comics).</li>

<li> The initial Batman stories were especially violent. Batman had no compunction about carrying a gun or killing his foes. Only later did Batman develop a code in which he refused to do either of those things, lest he sink to the level of the man who killed his parents.</li>

<li>Robin didn't show up until issue No 38. The young sidekick was the alter ego of Dick Grayson, part of a family of circus acrobats whose parents died in a high-wire accident. (It turned out that they'd been killed by mobsters who were shaking down the circus owner for protection money.) Naturally, Bruce Wayne identified with Dick's plight and adopted him as his war.</li>

<li>There have been several Robins since, including Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, and Damian Wayne (Bruce Wayne's son by Talia al Ghul).</li></ol>
<h3> Some more Stuff </h3>
<ul>

<li>Batman's first screen appearance was in a 1943 serial called "The Batman." It starred Lewis Wilson as Batman and Douglas Croft as Robin. Made at the height of World War II, the shorts featured as their villain a Japanese spy named Dr. Daka, played in yellowface by J. Carroll Naish. The series wasn't very good, though it did introduce the concept of the Batcave. It also introduced a thin version of Alfred the Butler, who was then drawn skinnier in the comics.</li>

<li>Another serial a few years later, 1949's "Batman and Robin," starring Robert Lowery and Johnny Duncan, was better. It had the Dynamic Duo facing off against a black-hooded mastermind called The Wizard.</li>

<li>Were Batman and Robin gay? That was the insinuation of Dr. Fredric Wertham, whose 1954 book "Seduction of the innocent" became a best-seller with its claim that comic books were contributing to a nationwide epidemic of juvenile delinquency. He denounced comics for their grim tone and sensationalist violence, and he singled out Batman comics in particular for centering on a rich playboy who wore tights and went out swinging at night with his teenage ward. The book led to Congressional hearings, which in turn led to the creation of the Comics Code Authority, the industry's self-censorship operation. To earn the CCA seal and be sold in stores, comic books had to tone down the violence and sexuality, and heroes became more overtly positive role models. DC characters like Superman and Batman became virtual boy scouts. With more sordid underworld and occult tales off-limits, Batman and Robin soon found themselves entangling with space aliens and other bizarre, sci-fi monsters.</li>

<li>The 1966-68 "Batman" TV series starring Adam West as Bruce Wayne and Burt Ward as Dick Grayson brought some of the kink back, but strictly as camp, so arch that it went over the heads of the children who were the show's target audience.(Watch the reruns now, as a grown-up -- IFC has been running them every weekend -- and you'll guffaw at how much they got away with.) Hardcore Bat-fans hated the campy silliness, but the show did revive the DC comic's flagging sales.</li>

<li>In one series of Batman comics, Bruce Wayne married Catwoman. Their daughter Helena Wayne grew up to be the Huntress.</li>

<li>Frank Miller is generally credited with restoring Batman to his old gritty self with "The Dark Knight Returns," a four-issue series published in1986, where an aged Batman comes out of retirement, joined by a new Robin, to clean up the streets of a Gotham run amok.</li>
